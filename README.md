# The N-word Counter Bot

User said the n-word? GET CAUGHT IN 4K.

User not verified to be black? MY N**** GET CAUGHT IN 8K.

With this bot, you can track how many times an individual has said the
n-word in your server, view the server total of n-words ever said (since
bot join date), and even user n-word rankings!

Not only that, you can also "verify" yourself to be black in order to
not be tracked by the bot.

How? Well you would need at least 3 other users to vouch for you in
claiming that you are black. The bot won't catch you anymore!

Utilizes Discord.py and MongoDB technology.

Currently under construction...
